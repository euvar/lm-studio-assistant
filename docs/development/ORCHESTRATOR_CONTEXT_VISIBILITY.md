# Orchestrator Context Visibility & Real-Time Control

## Overview
The orchestrator now has full visibility and control over all agent operations, with real-time monitoring and context passing.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Full Context Visibility
The orchestrator maintains complete context including:
- Execution history with unique task IDs
- Step-by-step progress tracking
- Previous results from all agents
- Original user request throughout execution

### 2. Enhanced Multi-Step Execution
```typescript
private async planAndExecuteMultiStep(
  context: AgentContext,
  analysis: any
): Promise<AgentResponse>
```

- Creates detailed execution plans
- Assigns specific agents to each step
- Tracks dependencies between steps
- Validates results before proceeding

### 3. Real-Time Agent Communication
When agents are controlled by orchestrator, they receive:
```typescript
metadata: {
  orchestratorTask: 'task_123456',
  currentStep: 1,
  totalSteps: 3,
  stepDescription: 'Create calculator.html file',
  expectedOutput: 'File created successfully',
  previousResults: [...],
  fullContext: {
    originalRequest: '—Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–π –∫–∞–ª—å–∫—É–ª—è—Ç–æ—Ä',
    conversationHistory: [...],
    executionPlan: {...}
  }
}
```

### 4. Step-by-Step Validation
After each step, the orchestrator:
1. Analyzes the result
2. Validates against expected output
3. Decides whether to continue, retry, or adjust
4. Maintains execution history

### 5. Agent Awareness
Other agents now see when they're being orchestrated:
```typescript
// In FileAgent
if (isOrchestrated) {
  console.log(`üìã Working on orchestrator task: ${context.metadata.orchestratorTask}`);
  console.log(`   Step ${context.metadata.currentStep}/${context.metadata.totalSteps}`);
}
```

## Example Flow

**User**: "—Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–π –∫–∞–ª—å–∫—É–ª—è—Ç–æ—Ä —Å HTML –∏ JavaScript"

**Orchestrator**:
1. Recognizes multi-step task
2. Creates execution plan:
   - Step 1: FileAgent creates HTML
   - Step 2: FileAgent creates JS
   - Step 3: SearchAgent finds UI patterns
3. Executes each step with full context
4. Validates results in real-time
5. Provides comprehensive summary

## Benefits

1. **Intelligent Coordination**: Orchestrator makes smart decisions about task execution
2. **Context Preservation**: No information lost between steps
3. **Error Recovery**: Can detect and handle failures gracefully
4. **Transparency**: Clear visibility into what's happening at each step
5. **Flexibility**: Can adjust plans based on intermediate results

## Technical Implementation

### Orchestrator Enhancements:
- `executionHistory: Map<string, any>` - Tracks all tasks
- `currentTaskId: string | null` - Active task identifier
- `planAndExecuteMultiStep()` - Multi-step execution
- `executeNextStep()` - Sequential step execution
- `analyzeStepResult()` - Real-time validation
- `getPreviousResults()` - Context accumulation
- `summarizeExecution()` - Final reporting

### Agent Context Enhancement:
All agents receive rich metadata when orchestrated, allowing them to:
- Understand their role in the larger task
- Access previous step results
- See the original user request
- Know what's expected of them

## Testing

```bash
# Run the context visibility test
npx tsx test-orchestrator-context.ts
```

The system now provides true orchestration with full visibility and intelligent control!
