## Technical Improvements

### Architecture
- Modular design with separate managers for different features
- Event-driven task execution system
- Clean separation of concerns

### User Experience
- Clean output mode by default (technical details hidden)
- Streaming responses with context indicators
- Better error messages and recovery
- Autocomplete improvements

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Proper error handling throughout
- Consistent coding patterns

## Usage Examples

### Checkpoints
```bash
> checkpoint
# Create a checkpoint at current conversation state

> checkpoints  
# View all checkpoints in tree format

> branch experiment-1
# Create a new branch from a checkpoint
```

### Task Planning
```bash
> plan create a REST API with Express.js
# Breaks down the task and executes it step by step
```

### Code Execution
The assistant can now safely execute code snippets:
- Python code with restricted imports
- JavaScript in sandboxed Node environment
- Automatic output capture and error handling

## Configuration

All new features respect the existing configuration system and can be toggled or customized through `~/.lm-assistant/config.json`.

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:
- Plugin system for custom tools
- Multi-language prompt support
- Cloud sync for checkpoints
- Collaborative features
- More language sandboxes (Ruby, Go, etc.)
