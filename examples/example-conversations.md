## Creating a Web Server

**User**: Create a simple Express server with a home page and API endpoint

**Assistant**: I'll help you create an Express server. Let me start by creating the necessary files.

*[Tool: writeFile - Creates server.js with Express setup]*

I've created a basic Express server with:
- Home route at /
- API endpoint at /api/users
- Port 3000

**User**: Add user authentication to the server

**Assistant**: I'll add authentication using JWT tokens. Let me update the server.

*[Tool: editFile - Adds authentication middleware]*
*[Tool: writeFile - Creates auth.js with JWT logic]*

Authentication added! The server now includes:
- JWT token generation
- Protected routes
- Login endpoint

## File Operations Example

**User**: I have multiple test files named test1.js, test2.js, etc. Rename them to spec1.js, spec2.js

**Assistant**: I'll help you rename those test files. Let me first see what test files you have.

*[Tool: listFiles - Lists all files in current directory]*
*[Tool: bash - Uses mv command to rename files]*

Successfully renamed 5 test files from test*.js to spec*.js pattern.

## Debugging with Web Search

**User**: I'm getting "Cannot find module 'express'" error

**Assistant**: Let me help you fix this error. First, I'll search for solutions.

*[Tool: webSearch - Searches for the error message]*

Based on the search results, this error typically means Express isn't installed. Let me check your package.json and install it.

*[Tool: readFile - Reads package.json]*
*[Tool: bash - Runs npm install express]*

Express has been installed successfully! The error should be resolved now.

## Working with Configuration

**User**: Create a configuration file for different environments

**Assistant**: I'll create a flexible configuration setup for your application.

*[Tool: writeFile - Creates config/default.json]*
*[Tool: writeFile - Creates config/production.json]*
*[Tool: writeFile - Creates config/index.js to load configs]*

Configuration system created with:
- Default settings
- Production overrides
- Environment-based loading

Your app can now use different configs based on NODE_ENV.
